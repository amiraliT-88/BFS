🚀 Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm

🔍 About the Project

This project demonstrates the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm — a classic graph traversal technique used to explore nodes in a graph level by level. BFS is especially useful for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs and is commonly applied in areas like pathfinding, networking, AI, and social graph analysis.

⚙️ How It Works

🔹 BFS starts from a selected node and explores all of its direct neighbors before moving to the next level.
🔹 It uses a queue to keep track of nodes to be explored.
🔹 The traversal continues until all reachable nodes have been visited.

🎯 Use Cases

✅ Finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs
✅ Web crawling (like how search engines discover pages)
✅ Analyzing social networks (e.g., friend recommendations)
✅ Puzzle solving (e.g., mazes, Rubik’s Cube)
✅ AI-based decision-making in games 🎮

📂 Project Structure

The repository includes a clean and simple implementation of BFS. The code is well-structured for easy understanding and modification.

🔧 Requirements

⚡ The algorithm is implemented in Python and requires only built-in libraries.
⚡ No external dependencies are needed.

🚀 Getting Started

Simply open the script and run it in any Python environment!
You can modify the graph structure or starting node to fit your needs.
