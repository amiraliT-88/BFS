Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm

About the Project

This project demonstrates the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm — a classic graph traversal technique used to explore nodes in a graph level by level. BFS is especially useful for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs and is commonly applied in areas like pathfinding, networking, AI, and social graph analysis.

How It Works

BFS begins at a selected starting node and explores all of its immediate neighbors before moving on to the neighbors’ neighbors. This traversal continues until all reachable nodes have been visited. The algorithm uses a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes to be explored next.

Use Cases

Finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs

Web crawling

Analyzing social networks

Puzzle solving (e.g., mazes or Rubik’s Cube)

AI-based decision making in games and simulations


Project Structure

The repository includes a simple and clean implementation of BFS. It is structured to be easy to understand and modify for educational or practical purposes.

Requirements

The algorithm is implemented in Python and requires only basic Python libraries. No external dependencies are needed.

Getting Started

To run the algorithm, simply open the script and execute it in any Python environment. You can modify the input graph or the starting node based on your use case.
